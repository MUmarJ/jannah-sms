# Webhook Configuration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to configure webhooks to receive SMS replies from tenants, enabling two-way SMS communication and automatic opt-in/opt-out processing.

## What is the Webhook?

The webhook is an endpoint on your server that TextBelt calls when a tenant replies to your SMS messages. This enables:

- âœ… **Automatic Opt-in Processing**: When tenants reply "YES" to opt-in requests
- âœ… **Automatic Opt-out Processing**: When tenants reply "STOP" to unsubscribe
- âœ… **A2P Compliance**: Required for Application-to-Person messaging regulations
- âœ… **Message History**: All replies are saved for review
- âœ… **Tenant Communication**: Track tenant responses

## How It Works

```
1. Your App sends SMS to tenant via TextBelt
   â†“
2. Tenant receives message and replies
   â†“
3. TextBelt receives reply
   â†“
4. TextBelt calls YOUR webhook with reply data
   â†“
5. Your app processes the reply:
   - If "YES"/"START" â†’ Mark tenant as opted-in
   - If "STOP" â†’ Mark tenant as opted-out
   - Otherwise â†’ Save for manual review
   â†“
6. Your app sends confirmation message
```

## Webhook Endpoint

**URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/webhooks/sms-reply`

**Method:** `POST`

**Code Location:** [app/api/v1/webhooks.py](app/api/v1/webhooks.py:35)

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Your Application

Before configuring webhooks, your application must be accessible from the internet:

#### Railway Deployment
```bash
# Follow DEPLOYMENT.md to deploy to Railway
# Your app will be available at: https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

#### Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# Configure custom domain in Railway dashboard
# Your app will be at: https://sms.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 2: Set Webhook URL

After deployment, update your environment variable:

#### In Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your project â†’ **Variables**
2. Click **+ New Variable**
3. Add:
   ```
   Name: WEBHOOK_URL
   Value: https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/v1/webhooks/sms-reply
   ```

#### In Local .env (for testing)
```bash
# .env
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/v1/webhooks/sms-reply
```

**Note:** For local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your local server:
```bash
ngrok http 8000
# Use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

Check that webhook URL is configured:

```bash
# Method 1: Check environment
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health

# Method 2: Check logs
# In Railway, view deployment logs to see:
# "Webhook URL configured: https://..."
```

### Step 4: Test Webhook

#### Test Locally
```bash
# Send a test webhook request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/webhooks/sms-reply \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "textId": "test-123",
    "fromNumber": "+15555551234",
    "text": "YES"
  }'

# Expected response:
# {"status": "success", "reply_id": 1}
```

#### Test in Production
1. Send an SMS to a tenant
2. Have them reply with "YES"
3. Check application logs for:
   ```
   Received SMS reply: {...}
   Processing opt-in for tenant X
   Sent opt-in confirmation
   ```

## Webhook Payload

TextBelt sends this data to your webhook:

```json
{
  "textId": "123456789",         // Original message ID
  "fromNumber": "+15555551234",  // Tenant's phone number
  "text": "YES",                 // Reply text
  "timestamp": 1697234567        // Unix timestamp
}
```

Your webhook processes this and returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "reply_id": 42
}
```

## Automatic Processing

### Opt-in Keywords (Case Insensitive)
- `YES`
- `Y`
- `START`
- `UNSTOP`
- `JOIN`
- `SUBSCRIBE`

**What Happens:**
1. Tenant status â†’ `opted_in`
2. `sms_opt_in_date` â†’ current timestamp
3. Confirmation message sent:
   ```
   "Thank you! You're now subscribed to Jannah Property Management
   SMS notifications. Reply STOP at any time to unsubscribe."
   ```

### Opt-out Keywords (Case Insensitive)
- `STOP`
- `STOPALL`
- `UNSUBSCRIBE`
- `CANCEL`
- `END`
- `QUIT`

**What Happens:**
1. Tenant status â†’ `opted_out`
2. `sms_opt_out_date` â†’ current timestamp
3. Confirmation message sent:
   ```
   "You've been unsubscribed from Jannah Property Management SMS
   notifications. Reply YES at any time to resubscribe."
   ```

### Other Replies
Any other text is saved to the database for manual review in the Messages section.

## Viewing Replies

### In the Application
1. Go to **Messages** â†’ **Replies**
2. View all tenant replies with:
   - Original message sent
   - Reply text
   - Timestamp
   - Processing status
   - Tenant name

### In Database
```sql
SELECT * FROM message_replies
ORDER BY received_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Security

### Webhook Security Measures
1. **HTTPS Only**: Webhook URL must use HTTPS in production
2. **Validation**: Phone numbers are validated and normalized
3. **Error Handling**: Failed webhooks don't crash the system
4. **Logging**: All webhook requests are logged for audit

### Optional: Add Webhook Secret
For enhanced security, you can add webhook signature verification:

```python
# In app/api/v1/webhooks.py
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook_signature(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        payload.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, signature)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Requests

**Check 1: Is webhook URL set?**
```bash
# In Railway variables, verify WEBHOOK_URL is set
echo $WEBHOOK_URL
```

**Check 2: Is endpoint accessible?**
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/v1/webhooks/sms-reply
# Should return 422 (method not allowed) not 404
```

**Check 3: Check TextBelt configuration**
```bash
# TextBelt must be configured to call your webhook
# Check TextBelt dashboard/API settings
```

### Replies Not Being Processed

**Check Logs:**
```
2025-10-13 13:00:00 INFO: Received SMS reply: {"textId": "123", ...}
2025-10-13 13:00:01 INFO: Processing opt-in for tenant 5 (John Doe)
2025-10-13 13:00:02 INFO: Sent opt-in confirmation to John Doe
```

**If missing:**
- Verify webhook URL is correctly set
- Check that application is running
- Verify tenant phone number matches

### Tenant Not Found

```
WARNING: Tenant not found for phone number: +15555551234
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure tenant's phone number in database matches reply number
- Phone numbers are matched by last 10 digits
- Check for formatting differences (spaces, dashes, etc.)

## Testing Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Webhook URL configured in environment
- [ ] Application deployed and accessible
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic on Railway)
- [ ] Test opt-in reply ("YES")
- [ ] Test opt-out reply ("STOP")
- [ ] Verify confirmation messages sent
- [ ] Check database for saved replies
- [ ] Review application logs for errors
- [ ] Test with unknown phone number

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Reply Processing

To add custom automated responses:

```python
# In app/api/v1/webhooks.py

def _is_payment_confirmation(text: str) -> bool:
    """Check if reply is payment confirmation."""
    normalized = text.strip().upper()
    return "PAID" in normalized or "PAYMENT" in normalized

# In receive_sms_reply function:
elif _is_payment_confirmation(payload.text):
    # Mark tenant rent as paid
    tenant.is_current_month_rent_paid = True
    reply.processed = True
    # Send confirmation
```

### Webhook Retry Logic

If your webhook fails, TextBelt may retry. Handle idempotency:

```python
# Check if reply already processed
existing = db.query(MessageReply).filter(
    MessageReply.text_id == payload.textId
).first()

if existing:
    return {"status": "already_processed", "reply_id": existing.id}
```

## Cost Implications

**TextBelt Webhook Calls:**
- Free to receive
- No additional charges
- Only pay for outgoing SMS

**Railway Bandwidth:**
- Minimal impact
- Webhook payloads are small (~1KB each)
